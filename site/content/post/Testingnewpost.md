Hi there, my name is Kristin and I'm stressed out of my mind.

Sometimes I get really frustrated and I want to throw things across the room. 

Maybe one of my next business ventures should be creating a place that let's you throw plates and things against a wall to get out anger and agression and stress. 
Like art therapy, but instead of creating art, you're throwing it against a wall.
